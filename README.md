**Description**:As part of my Codtech UI/UX Internship project, I created a redesigned login interface for KFC’s mobile application, focusing on simplicity, brand alignment, and user experience. The right side of the image displays the improved design, tailored for the iPhone 16 Pro layout. The interface uses a clean white background to create a minimal and modern look, allowing key elements to stand out. At the top, the KFC logo is prominently displayed in red, instantly reinforcing brand recognition. Below it, the login form is centered with clean input fields for username and password, using thin grey lines for a sleek, unobtrusive design. The familiar Colonel Sanders illustration is subtly integrated into the background, reinforcing the brand identity without overwhelming the interface.

The “Login” and “Sign Up” buttons are clearly distinguished in red and blue, respectively, and are placed below the form for intuitive access. Additionally, a green “Continue as Guest” button offers flexible navigation for users who prefer to browse without signing in. The color scheme—red, blue, and green—adds vibrancy while maintaining a professional tone aligned with KFC’s branding. This redesign improves visual hierarchy, accessibility, and user friendliness, making it an ideal enhancement for mobile food ordering experiences.
